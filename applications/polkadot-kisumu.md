# üñºÔ∏è dApp Template for an ink! contract using the Solidity ABI

- **Team Name:** Polkadot Kisumu
- **Payment Address:** Polkadot payment address.

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

A dApp Template using a Solidity frontend library with an ink! contract that has the Solidity ABI enabled.

This project aims to deliver:
- A smart contract demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, written in ink! and compiled with Solidity ABI support enabled.
- A website frontend for this contract, built using an established Solidity TypeScript (or JavaScript) library/framework (e.g., ethers.js, web3.js, wagmi, etc.).
- MetaMask integration for seamless contract interactions from the frontend.

**Relation to ink! ecosystem:**  
This project bridges the gap between ink! smart contracts and the large ecosystem of Solidity tooling and dApp frameworks, making ink! contracts more accessible to developers familiar with Ethereum tools.

**Category:** Technical Showcase / Canary Dapp  
**Motivation:**  
Our team is passionate about expanding the usability and reach of ink! smart contracts by enabling developers to use familiar Solidity-based frontend tools and workflows.

### Ink! Ecosystem Impact

This template will significantly lower the barrier for Ethereum developers to experiment with and adopt ink! smart contracts. By providing a working example of a CRUD contract with Solidity ABI enabled and a frontend using standard Solidity libraries and MetaMask, the project will:

- Demonstrate interoperability between ink! contracts and Ethereum dApp tooling.
- Serve as a reference implementation for teams wanting to port or build dApps on Polkadot using ink! with minimal friction.
- Encourage more frontend developers to build on Polkadot/Substrate by leveraging their existing skills and tools.
- Promote ink! as a viable smart contract language for projects seeking EVM compatibility and beyond.

### Project Details

- **Data models / API specifications:**  
  The contract will expose CRUD operations for a simple data structure (e.g., a list of records with fields like id, name, value). The ABI will be compatible with Solidity tooling.

- **Technology stack:**  
  - Smart contract: ink! (Rust), compiled with Solidity ABI enabled.
  - Frontend: React (TypeScript), using ethers.js or web3.js for contract interaction.
  - Wallet: MetaMask for user authentication and transaction signing.
  - Tooling: Hardhat/Foundry for frontend contract interaction testing.

- **Documentation:**  
  - Inline code documentation.
  - Step-by-step tutorial for deploying the contract and connecting the frontend.
  - Guide for extending the template for custom use cases.

- **PoC/MVP:**  
  - A working demo contract and frontend will be provided.
  - Example deployment scripts and test cases.

- **Limitations:**  
  - The template will not cover advanced contract patterns (e.g., upgradability, complex access control).
  - No tokenomics or business logic beyond CRUD.
  - No backend server; all interactions are on-chain or via the frontend.

- **CATEGORY:** Technical Showcase / Canary Dapp

- **Business model:**  
  - Open-source template for the community; no direct monetization.
  - Potential for future consulting, support, or premium features.

- **Future production plans:**  
  - Encourage adoption by other teams.
  - Gather feedback and iterate on the template.
  - Explore additional integrations (e.g., wallet providers, more complex contract examples).
